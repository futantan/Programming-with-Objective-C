# Objective-C初见

This document introduces the Objective-C language and offers extensive examples of its use. You’ll learn how to create your own classes describing custom objects and see how to work with some of the framework classes provided by Cocoa and Cocoa Touch. Although the framework classes are separate from the language, their use is tightly wound into coding with Objective-C and many language-level features rely on behavior offered by these classes.

这份文档介绍了Objective-C语言并且提供了大量的使用实例。你将学会如何定制并创建自己的类，如何使用Cocoa和Cocoa Touch框架提供的类。尽管框架提供的类和语言本身是分离的，但是你将会经常用到他们，而且许多语言级别的特性依赖于这些框架提供的类。
